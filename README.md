# IoT-Posture-Monitor
This project uses an ESP32 paired with a tilt sensor or MPU6050 accelerometer to detect poor posture. When the tilt angle crosses a threshold, the system activates an alert via LED or buzzer. The project includes documentation, code, diagrams, and a simulation link. Designed for fast learning and easy customization.
